- apogee2_score_filtered.txt: apogee score filtered from MitImpact_db_3.1.2.txt. In particular, scores for protein variants. In particular, it contains APOGEE1,2 scores and score 2 probabilities, as well as type (VUS-, VUS+ LB, B, etc.)
- apogee2_trna.csv and .xlsx: Contains apogee2 scores for tRNAs.
- functional_variant_tRNA_anticodon_table.tsv: Table often referred to as annotations in analysis scripts. Table containing all possible mitochondrial genome variants.
- genome_loci_table.csv: complete table of every possible single nucleotide variant in the mitochondrial genome associated with its genomic region.
- mtGeneSize.txt: Size of protein-coding genes on the mitochondrial genome.
